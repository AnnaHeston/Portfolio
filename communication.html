		<h1 class="pageheading">Communication</h1>
		<p class="pagetext">Like any work, being an effective developer requires that you posess skills well beyond the ability to create a product. As an educator, I have more than a decade of formal training in communicating ideas to people of all skill levels and collaborating with teams. As an executive coach, I was able to futher refine this practice not only when working with students in higher education but also in communicating with my company's client partners. It is not useful to have an excellent product if your client doesn't know it's capabilites or if your shared goals are hidden. I seek the opportuniy to join a dynamic team enviroment because the power of a cohesive group of dedicated co-workers is motivating and inspires a great product.</p>
