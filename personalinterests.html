		<p class="pagetext">I am a mother of two and live in North Portland. In my free time I enjoy baking with my daughter, having weekly dinner nights with friends, and going on walks with my family. I've always had an interest in design and believe that all things should have design consideration for their function and beauty. Having already completed one house, my husband and I are excited to turn our new house into a dynamic but calming environment. Much of my free time is spent on house projects, which makes my inner designer very happy.</p>
